## MPaxos


[MPaxos] is an experimental Paxos codebase for research purposes. 

The code is still changing every day! Don't use it for serious matters.

### License

MPaxos use [SATA License](LICENSE.txt) (Star And Thank Author License, originally [here](https://github.com/zTrix/sata-license)), so you have to star this project before any using:) 

### Publication

We have a few publications based on this Paxos codebase:

 - When Paxos Meets Erasure Code: Reduce Network and Storage Cost in State Machine Replication ([HPDC14](http://www.hpdc.org/2014/program/))
 - When Paxos Meets 2PC: Efficient Transactions across Parallel Geo-Replicated State Machines (in submission)

If you use MPaxos in your publications, you are very welcome to let us know.

### Documents

There is now a very simple [getting started guide](https://github.com/msmummy/mpaxos/wiki/getting-started-guide).

If you want more documents from research guys... Seriously?
